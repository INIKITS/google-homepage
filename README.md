The project was to create a homepage that looks like the google homepage. I learned about styling through CSS and spent a lot of time reading on flexbox and how to align elements in a page. 

The way I initially set my code up caused me to have to go back and change a lot of things. In the future I'll know what to look for and how to start off on a better route. It's not perfect, but I came close to what I wanted to see and I learned a lot.

 2/3 through my project my linux VM crashed and caused a corruption in my local files so I had to rebuild a new repository after a couple hours of googling and coming to the conclusion I could not recover the original commits.

 Things I learned: How to create headers and footers / how to style input areas / importing fonts / using functions to style multiple things at once / how to link from images / how to prevent buttons from moving each other when hovered over / pre-planning for unexpected crashes (pushing to repository)

 Things I still need to work on: General upkeep of codespace / getting a layout for the webpage before starting / layout basics and how to place elements exactly where I want them.
